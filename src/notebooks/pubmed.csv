38145447,Boundary Spanning Methodological Approaches for Collaborative Moose Governance in Eeyou Istchee.,2023-12-25,Environmental management,Environ Manage,"['Nathan A Badry', 'Gwyneth A MacMillan', 'Eleanor R Stern', 'Manuelle Landry-Cuerrier', 'Gordon M Hickey', 'Murray M Humphries']","Natural resource governance challenges are often highly complex, particularly in Indigenous contexts. These challenges involve numerous landscape-level interactions, spanning jurisdictional, disciplinary, social, and ecological boundaries. In Eeyou Istchee, the James Bay Cree Territory of northern Quebec, Canada, traditional livelihoods depend on wild food species like moose. However, these species are increasingly being impacted by forestry and other resource development projects. The complex relationships between moose, resource development, and Cree livelihoods can limit shared understandings and the ability of diverse actors to respond to these pressures. Contributing to this complexity are the different knowledge systems held by governance actors who, while not always aligned, have broadly shared species conservation and sustainable development goals. This paper presents fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) as a methodological approach used to help elicit and interpret the knowledge of land-users concerning the impacts of forest management on moose habitat in Eeyou Istchee. We explore the difficulties of weaving this knowledge together with the results of moose GPS collar analysis and the knowledges of scientists and government agencies. The ways in which participatory, relational mapping approaches can be applied in practice, and what they offer to pluralistic natural resource governance research more widely, are then addressed.","['Co-management', 'Indigenous and local knowledge', 'Knowledge weaving', 'Ontological pluralism', 'Wildlife']",doi,10.1007/s00267-023-01918-6
